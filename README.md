This project focuses on designing and implementing a decentralized student record management system using Hyperledger Fabric. The primary goal is to overcome the challenges of traditional systems where student data can be altered, lost, or mismanaged. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures data transparency, immutability, and security.

The project employs smart contracts (chaincode) to automate record management tasks such as adding new student records, updating academic details, and verifying credentials. Every transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, making the data tamper-proof and verifiable across multiple institutions.

Additionally, the system provides efficient accessibility for authorized stakeholders like universities, examination boards, and employers, enabling a trusted mechanism for academic credential verification. This blockchain-based approach demonstrates how decentralized technologies can significantly improve trust, scalability, and operational efficiency in the education sector.
